                    The Polaris Letter searches for actionable investment opportunities within the changing global macro landscape. I take a top-down approach, which can form the basis of an asset allocation decision, or serve as a guide to identify opportunities in individual situations.

                <p class="first-screen__text">
                    We are in a time of macro turmoil, when active investment decisions can produce big advantages. With stock and bond valuations around the world at multi-decade highs, the typical 60/40 stock and bond portfolio cannot be expected to perform very well. Over the longer term, of 7-12 years, it is likely to underperform cash, even if the macro environment remained relatively rosy. But cash itself has become highly risky, when the world's major governments seem headed into a global crisis of debts and deficits, ultimately resolved by central bank money creation. At the institutional and individual level, people have embraced "passive" portfolios of stocks, bonds and cash at exactly the moment when this approach is likely to fail badly.

                    Investment Philosophy: Asset allocation, informed by a big-picture view, is perhaps the most important part of the investment process. In practice, however, hardly anyone is making rational and informed asset allocation decisions. At big pension funds and endowments, sometimes with tens of billions of dollars, active asset allocation decisions tend to be done by inexpert committees, hobbled by all the careerist pressures typical of the position, which usually amounts to performance-chasing. But, if the goal is to buy low and sell high, then it is almost a tautology that assets with a long recent history of outperformance also have high prices.
                    <br><br>
                    The general failure of this approach has pushed more and more institutions toward purely passive "60/40" portfolios, abandoning the asset allocation decision altogether. Professional money managers, at mutual funds and hedge funds, are commonly locked into a defined mandate, such as being 100% long some market or sector, or having a market-neutral long-short portfolio. In other words, they have no involvement in asset allocation, and are mostly focused on relative performance. Career pressures force most of them to stick close to index weightings. Even global macro hedge funds, which seem to have all the freedom in the world, commonly have to fit their strategies to investor demands for stable, low volatility return profiles, which tends to lead to unproductive short-term trading, commonly in currencies and bonds. The majority of Registered Investment Advisors hew to a standardized passive portfolio, sometimes adjusted to individual needs.

                <p class="investment__text">
                    As we move among specific business sectors, or from country to country or region to region, we find plenty of specialists in that sector or region, but little guidance as to why we might prefer one sector or region to another. The macro investor must accept that they will never be a real expert at anything, except this big-picture view. One effect of this tendency of the entire professional management industry toward market/sector specialization and relative performance is that, at least for the largest companies in a market or industry, "market efficiency" is the norm. Those sector or market specialists, who spend all day determining why this steel company stock may be better than that one, or what companies in the large-cap index (in which they are required to be 100% long) have the best prospects, actually do a good job. It is quite difficult, for example, to find a U.S. largecap manager that outperforms an index by 3% per year; and even these outstanding managers often have stretches of underperformance when their method is out of style. The outcome is that we can bypass a lot of this by simply using a sector or region index ETF, in this way gaining the advantages of diversification while also reducing much of the need to research individual companies. Or, if possible, we can identify an outstanding manager. This allows us to focus more upon the big picture.

                            The <i>Polaris Letter</i>, a traditional monthly newsletter aimed at broad asset allocation for individuals or institutions. The approach is slow-moving, and mostly makes use of ETFs, index funds and mutual funds to take advantage of long-term macro trends. This approach leads directly toward asset allocation decisions for individual IRAs or 401(k)s, and can also be useful to institutional asset allocators, as found at pension funds or endowments. A concise, standalone monthly format, which can be easier to follow and make use of than a constant running commentary.
